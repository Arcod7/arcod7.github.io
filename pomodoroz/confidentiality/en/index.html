      This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Pomodoroz collects, uses,

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>
      Pomodoroz does not collect any personal data or personally identifiable
      information from its users. The App operates in a completely local
      environment, and all data related to the Pomodoro technique is stored
      locally on the user's device.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Collected Information</h2>

    <p>
      Since Pomodoroz does not collect any user information, we do not use any
      collected information for any purpose. The App is designed to respect user
      privacy by keeping all data local and not transmitting it to any external
      servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
      Pomodoroz does not share any personal information or data with third
      parties, as no such information is collected in the first place.
    </p>

      collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to
      review this privacy policy periodically and become aware of modifications.
